-- Fix RLS policies to work with the current ID-based system instead of auth.uid()
-- Since this app uses custom user IDs, we need to adjust the policies

-- Drop the restrictive RLS policies that require auth.uid()
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own contacts" ON public.contacts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own contacts" ON public.contacts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own contacts" ON public.contacts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own contacts" ON public.contacts;

-- Disable RLS on contacts table since the app manages its own access control
ALTER TABLE public.contacts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Keep RLS on other tables but make them more permissive for the current system
-- Update conversations policy to be more permissive
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update conversations they participate in" ON public.conversations;
CREATE POLICY "Allow conversation updates" ON public.conversations
FOR UPDATE USING (true);

-- Update messages policy to be more permissive  
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own messages" ON public.messages;
CREATE POLICY "Allow message operations" ON public.messages
FOR ALL USING (true);
